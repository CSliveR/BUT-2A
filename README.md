# Second Year Computer Science Bachelor Repository

## Description

This repository gathers all the content stored on my computer related to the second year of the Computer Science Bachelor program at IUT2 of Grenoble.

## Repository Content

The repository is organized by *resources*, which correspond to the different subjects (modules) taught during the second year.

## About Resource Naming

The folder names follow the official naming conventions used in the French university system for this program:

- Resources starting with **R** refer to theoretical or practical modules.
- Resources starting with **S** refer to **SAEs**, which stands for *Situations d’Apprentissage et d’Évaluation* (Learning and Assessment Situations), meaning larger projects or practical cases combining multiple skills.

The number **before the dot** indicates the **semester number**, and the number **after the dot** identifies the specific resource or SAE within that semester.

For example:

- `R4.01` refers to resource 01 of semester 4.
